    <p>    If you’ve come to this site, or live in New York City, you likely already know something about sanitary plumbing. But check out the About Us Page if you really want to get personal. Sanitary has been THE preeminent “hyper-local” blue-chip plumbing brands for close to 100 years. We started servicing the Bronx, where we’re still headquartered, expanded our service areas to all of Manhattan by the 1980’s and also from individual customers and families to full-property customers and real-estate holding companies, and today provide just about every type of plumbing service and component throughout all the boroughs of New York City and to all types of customers who expect the best and want some rest.</p>

     <div class="OurPurpose__description1 "><h1 class="section__header">Our Purpose</h1>
     <p>
        Your home should be your castle, even if it’s a one bedroom apartment, or a multi-unit building for your customers.
        It should be a place where you or your customers can be comfortable and relaxed with family and friends. An oasis. Where background support and needs are running smoothly without having to think about anything by enjoying the present.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="OurPurpose__description2">
        <p>
            <span class="OurPurpose__description2--text">Our Purpose</span> is to restore that secure feeling of home as an oasis from the stressors of outside life whenever something that shouldn’t go wrong, inevitably does. By installing the most reliable support systems- or quickly and completely fixing any issues that pop up- with these water, heat, or electrical systems often taken for granted as part of civilized living.

And it’s not just what we do, but how we do it: striving to consistently service our customers in a mindful and friendly manner, so they can return to a relaxing and recuperative environment without having to worry about important things that should run on their own in the first place

     <h3 class="AboutUs__title--small">People and Science with Service</h3>
     <p class="AboutUs__description">Sanitary Plumbing & Heating Corp. has been a leading provider of plumbing and heating services since it was founded in 1929.

        Even today, it’s still lead by the Clark family, brothers Harris and Jonathan Clark. They are the third generation of Clarks since their grandfather founded Sanitary 90 years ago.
        
        The company was one of the original “hyper-locals”, that is, always headquartered in New York City, today in the Bronx and all of us collectively -managers, technicians, and customers-hail from all of New York’s Boroughs. “Family” has always been one of our core values, from our team to customers. Thus our tagline: “Professionals helping Neighbors”.
        
        We take the science with service of plumbing seriously, as it, like our sister services, keeps your homes running so you can enjoy home without having to think about it.</p>
