        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>
          Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
          It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
          It is used for:

          <li>Database connectionJava is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
</li>
          <li>GamesIt has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
</li>
          <li>Web servers and application serversIt is secure, fast and powerful
</li>
          <li>Web applicationIt is open-source and freeIt is easy to learn and simple to use

        <h3>Some PCs might have Java already installed.t</h3>
        <p>To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>
        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>java -version</code>
        <code>java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)</code>

        <p>
          In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad).
The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:
        </p>
        <code>public class Main { <br>
          public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
        }</code>
       <p>

        Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code above.

      <section id="Java_Syntax" class="main-section">
        <header>Java Syntax</header>
        <p>
          In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:
        </p>
        
        <code>public class Main { <br>
          public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
            System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
        }</code>
       <h2>Example explained</h2>
       <p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
       </p> <p>Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
   </p>    <p> The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:</p>
        <code>Hello World</code>

      <!-- section 6-->
      <section id="The_main_Method" class="main-section">
        <header>The main Method</header>
        <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
        <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
        <p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.</p>

       <p>   For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.</p>
