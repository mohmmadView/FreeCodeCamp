        <p id="tribute-info">The Omidvar Brothers are an Iranian duo who are known for their world travel documentary. In 1954, the brothers set out on a 10-year journey around the world, first on motorbikes and later in a Citroën 2CV. They visited over 50 countries and documented their travels in a film called "The World is Our Home."

            The Omidvar Brothers were born in Tehran, Iran, in the early 1930s. They were both interested in film and photography from a young age. In 1954, they decided to embark on a journey around the world to document different cultures and people.
            
            The brothers started their journey on motorbikes, but they soon switched to a Citroën 2CV because it was more practical. They traveled through Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. They met with many different people and experienced many different cultures.
            
            The Omidvar Brothers' film "The World is Our Home" was a critical and commercial success. It won several awards and was shown at film festivals around the world. The film helped to raise awareness of the diversity of cultures and people around the world.
            
            The Omidvar Brothers' journey was an inspiration to many people. They showed that it is possible to travel the world and experience different cultures, even if you come from a small country like Iran. They are an inspiration to all who dream of traveling the world.

             All along their journey, the Omidvar Brothers would act as anthropologists and film all their observations. They captured incredible moments among primitive tribes and aboriginal populations, with whom they lived for several months.

             They had to eat raw meat with the Eskimos, and share the daily life of many remote populations. Some population’s lifestyles and cultures that the Omidvar Brothers have captured in their documentary have since then completely disappeared.

             From small villages to large cities, they pictured a world where we are “all different, all relatives”, according to the motto that was attached to their bikes. Their documentary shows vast virgin forests and remote populations living in harmony far from the modern world.
